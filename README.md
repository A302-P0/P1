# P1 - Title is a work in Progress
This programme has been developed by the data science group, A303, at Aalborg University.

## About this Project
We have set out to develop a programme to help the user structure most of their energy consumption in the hours of less demand and in times of renewable energy overproduction, to pave the way for regular people to know when they can use extra energy cheaply, for free or even at a negative price. We want to make variable energy prices more easily digestible and help raise energy awareness.

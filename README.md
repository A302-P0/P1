# P1 - Raising Energy Awareness
This programme has been developed by the data science group, A303, at Aalborg University.

## About this Project
We have set out to develop a programme to help the user structure most of their energy consumption in the hours of less demand and in times of renewable energy overproduction, to pave the way for regular people to know when they can use extra energy cheaply, for free or even at a negative price. We want to make variable energy prices more easily digestible and help raise energy awareness.

### Build / Compile Instructions
We have created a makefile to easily compile the programme. Simply run `make` from the P1 folder, in your terminal or commando prompt of choice. The makefile will compile the programme, depending on your operation system. Find your OS below for further instructions:

**If you are running _MacOS_ or _Linux_**\
You will have a main.out file in the build folder. You will have to run it from the P1 folder (as with the make file) to have access to all of the files.
You do this with the line `./build/main.out`.

**If you are running _Windows_**\
You will have a main.exe file in the build folder. You will have to run it from the P1 folder (as with the make file) to have access to all of the files.
You do this with the line `./build/main.exe`.
